Servo-powered car that seeks quiet.

Maybe you've had this feeling. It's a bit loud, you don't really like people that much, maybe you don't know anyone, or maybe you normally like being around people, but you're in the middle of a project or a particularly exciting piece of your book.

You want to hide away, run to the quietest place around.

I made this robot as an experiment: can I make a simple robot that reacts in a manner similar to a recognizable human emotion? Or even a robot which, like a wild animal, avoids sounds and groups of people?

Can I make a robot that scurries, panics, escapes?

This robot takes in sound data from its left and right, then compares the raw data and moves away from the louder side.
